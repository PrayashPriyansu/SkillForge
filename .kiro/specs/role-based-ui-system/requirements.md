# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Role-Based UI System will centralize role management and provide clean separation between mentor and mentee interfaces throughout the SkillForge platform. This system will eliminate scattered conditional rendering logic, improve maintainability, and ensure consistent role-based experiences across all components. The feature will establish a centralized authentication and role context that can be easily consumed by any component, replacing the current pattern of individual role checks scattered throughout the codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized role management system, so that I can easily determine user roles without scattered conditional logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL establish a centralized role context provider
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL determine their role (mentor/mentee) from group membership data
3. WHEN components need role information THEN the system SHALL provide a clean hook interface for accessing role data
4. IF a user has multiple roles across different groups THEN the system SHALL handle role context switching appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mentor, I want to see only mentor-specific UI elements, so that I have a clean interface focused on my teaching responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mentor views any page THEN the system SHALL show creation, editing, and management controls
2. WHEN a mentor views course content THEN the system SHALL display analytics, progress tracking, and administrative options
3. WHEN a mentor views tests THEN the system SHALL show test creation, editing, preview, and results management
4. IF a mentor switches between groups THEN the system SHALL update the interface to reflect their role in the current group

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mentee, I want to see only learning-focused UI elements, so that I have a distraction-free learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mentee views any page THEN the system SHALL hide all creation, editing, and administrative controls
2. WHEN a mentee views course content THEN the system SHALL show only consumption interfaces like progress tracking and content viewing
3. WHEN a mentee views tests THEN the system SHALL show only test-taking interfaces and their own results
4. WHEN a mentee accesses restricted functionality THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and alternative actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want role-based component variants, so that I can create clean, maintainable UI components without scattered conditionals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating components THEN the system SHALL provide role-aware component variants (MentorView, MenteeView)
2. WHEN components need role-specific rendering THEN the system SHALL offer declarative role-based rendering utilities
3. WHEN building layouts THEN the system SHALL provide role-aware layout components that automatically adjust
4. IF components need complex role logic THEN the system SHALL provide composable role-checking utilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent role-based navigation, so that I only see relevant menu items and navigation options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views navigation menus THEN the system SHALL show only role-appropriate menu items
2. WHEN a user accesses different sections THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent role-based navigation patterns
3. WHEN a user switches groups THEN the system SHALL update navigation to reflect their role in the new context
4. IF a user tries to access unauthorized routes THEN the system SHALL redirect them appropriately with clear messaging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based route protection, so that users can only access functionality appropriate to their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users navigate to protected routes THEN the system SHALL verify their role permissions before allowing access
2. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate pages with clear error messages
3. WHEN role permissions change THEN the system SHALL update route access accordingly
4. IF route protection fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback interfaces and clear user guidance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate hardcoded role checks, so that the codebase is maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing existing components THEN the system SHALL replace all hardcoded `isMentor` checks with centralized role utilities
2. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL enforce use of centralized role management patterns
3. WHEN role logic changes THEN the system SHALL require updates in only centralized locations
4. IF inconsistent role patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL provide development-time warnings or errors

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless role switching between groups, so that I can manage multiple groups with different roles efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user belongs to multiple groups THEN the system SHALL provide a clear group/role switching interface
2. WHEN switching between groups THEN the system SHALL update the entire UI to reflect the new role context
3. WHEN role context changes THEN the system SHALL persist the selection for the user session
4. IF role switching fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous state and provide clear error feedback
